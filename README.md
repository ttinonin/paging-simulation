# Page Replacement Algorithm Simulation

This project is a simulation of operating system page replacement algorithms. It aims to model and evaluate how different page replacement strategies impact memory usage and performance in an operating system environment.

# Algorithms Implemented

- FIFO
- LRU
- OPT

# Usage

`python main.py <number_of_pages> <sequence_of_pages_separeted_by_coma> <algorithm>`

## Example

`python main.py 3 7,0,1,2,0,3,0,4,2,3,0,3,2,1,2,0,1,7,0,1 fifo`
